# Getting Started with Chat2Repo

## üéØ What is Chat2Repo?

Chat2Repo is an intelligent chat application similar to GitHub Copilot Chat, designed for Gitee.com repositories. It uses AI agents to help you understand and explore open-source projects through natural language conversations.

## üåü Key Features

### 1. Repository Q&A
Chat with any Gitee repository:
- Automatically reads files and code
- Understands project structure
- Supports multi-turn conversations
- Provides accurate answers based on actual code

### 2. Tech Solution Search
Get open-source solutions for technical problems:
- Searches Gitee for relevant projects
- Evaluates project quality
- Recommends 2-5 best solutions
- Analyzes pros and cons of each solution

## üöÄ Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Configure Environment

```bash
# Copy the example config
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key
GITEE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-gitee-token
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Run the Application

```bash
python main.py
```

That's it! The service is now running at http://localhost:8000

## üí¨ Your First Chat

### Option 1: Use the CLI Tool

```bash
python cli.py interactive
```

Then in the interactive mode:
```
> repo dromara hutool
> What is this project about?
```

### Option 2: Use the API

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/chat/repo \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "repo_owner": "dromara",
    "repo_name": "hutool",
    "question": "What is this project about?"
  }'
```

### Option 3: Use the API Documentation

Visit http://localhost:8000/docs to see the interactive API documentation.
